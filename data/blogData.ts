      <p class="mb-4">Selling a car that is no longer roadworthy in Dubai involves specific procedures set by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA). Whether your car has been in a major accident or has simply reached the end of its life, you cannot just leave it parked on the street.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Assessing the Condition</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">First, determine if your car is truly "scrap" or if it has resale value as a used car. If the repair costs exceed the vehicle's market value, it is generally considered a total loss or scrap.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. RTA Deregistration</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Before selling a scrap car, you must deregister it. This involves:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Removing the number plates.</li>
        <li>Visiting an RTA customer happiness center.</li>
        <li>Paying any outstanding fines.</li>
        <li>Obtaining a "Possession Certificate" or specific scrap certificate.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Finding a Buyer</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Once paperwork is sorted, you need a reliable buyer. <strong>SellMyCar.ae</strong> specializes in buying scrap cars directly from your location, often handling the towing for free.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Holding onto an old car for sentimental reasons is common, but financially, it might be draining your wallet. Here is how to know when to let go.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Frequent Breakdowns</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">If you are visiting the mechanic more than once a month, the car is becoming a liability.</p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Safety Features are Outdated</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">Newer cars come with advanced safety tech like blind-spot monitoring and automatic braking. If your old car lacks basic airbags or ABS, it might be time to upgrade.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. Rust and Corrosion</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">In the UAE's humid coastal climate, rust can spread quickly. Once structural rust sets in, the car becomes unsafe to drive.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Getting a fair price for a used car depends on multiple dynamic factors. At SellMyCar.ae, we use AI-driven data combined with physical inspections to give you the best offer.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-serif font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Key Factors</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Make and Model:</strong> Toyotas and Nissans generally hold value better in the UAE than niche European brands.</li>
        <li><strong>Mileage:</strong> Lower mileage always commands a premium.</li>
        <li><strong>Service History:</strong> A full agency service history is a massive plus.</li>
        <li><strong>Accident History:</strong> Even repaired accidents can lower value significantly.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="mb-4">For scrap cars, the value is largely determined by the weight of the metal and the salvageable parts (engine, gearbox, catalytic converter).</p>
